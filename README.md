# NEXT-SASS

Why would I use this?

- Quickly start a project with TypeScript, SASS, and NextJS.
- Convenient global CSS reset file.
- You got tired of using CSS-in-JS.
- You want to make a website quickly.

### Setup (MacOS)

Start by cloning the repository, or by clicking on **Use this template** above.

Then run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3005` in your browser of choice. Enjoy!

### Scripts

If you need to run node script without running the server, use this example to get started

```sh
npm run script example
```
